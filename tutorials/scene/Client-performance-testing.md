# Automated client performance testing

## Keywords: Automated test, PerfDog

## Business challenge

PerfDog is a performance tool for mobile platforms, available on Android and iOS. Automated performance testing can be customized through secondary development of PerfDogService, which is open to the public by PerfDog. All PerfDog data are collected by human beings, so the collection efficiency and accuracy are low. At the same time, the iteration speed of the test package is very fast, so the pressure of human testing is very great.

## BKCI Advantage

On BKCI, the performance automation interface of PerfDog Service is invoked through encapsulation to achieve the purpose of automatic data collection and labeling of different scene phases.
