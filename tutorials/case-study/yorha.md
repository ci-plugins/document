yorha Technology Co., Ltd. is an innovative technology company located in Shanghai, focusing on mobile game development. The core founding team has been working in the game industry for more than 10 years on average, and has developed 3 game products with annual flow of more than 1 billion. Currently, yorha has 3 projects in development, focusing on strategy tracks and targeting the global market.  

In 2021, yorha starts the development of new businesses. Considering the business cloud-native usage scenario and the demand for CD capability in the overseas self-publishing scenario, we chose to use BK BKCI to replace the mainstream DevOps tools commonly used in the industry as the CI/CD tool for this business. 


By using the BK BKCI tool, yorha has achieved the following efficiency gains in the CI/CD process:

 **1. saving about 0.5 development manpower** in the process of locating build issues through the visual pipeline interface

**2. Integrating the process of client-side version testing into the pipeline through a unified distribution channel for the mobile version experience function provides the following capabilities for client-side testing scenarios:**

&emsp; **a. Permission-protected version package download and viewing, reducing version security risks**
    
&emsp; **b. One-click package out for enterprise WeChat applications that can be operated by both planners and artists, reducing engineer input and communication costs**
    
&emsp; **c. Unified version for management channels, to avoid version confusion and mis-issuance**
    
&emsp; **d. Build process notifications sent to enterprise WeChat**

**3. Reduce the difficulty of back-end developers to develop game cloud native architecture through BCS, the container management platform of BK, and achieve full automation of CI/CD on BKCI, including lossless updates, state retention and network mapping, and other special scenarios under game cloud native architecture. ** 
            

For the usage experience, Kai-Feng Huang, technical leader of yorha, said, "The ability of BlueShield pipeline building does not differ from several mainstream DevOps products in the industry, but the visualization page not only lowers its usage threshold, but also greatly improves the efficiency of our issue troubleshooting. In addition, both the functionality of the client-side version experience and the linkage with BK's container management platform can be easily achieved through BKCI plug-ins, and the diverse plug-in ecology also allows us to fully automate the overall CI/CD process. " 

Currently, BlueShield has gradually become the base for all business development and release within yorha, and various scenarios of CI/CD are realized one by one through the BlueShield pipeline. Next, yorha will explore the development of BKCI plug-ins and BK applications, and more capabilities will be integrated into BK BKCI in a way that yorha can customize. The BK BKCI ecosystem, which belongs to yorha, is about to take shape.
