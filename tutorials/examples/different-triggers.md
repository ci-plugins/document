# Use different triggers in your pipeline

The Trigger mode is used by selecting different types of plug-ins under the trigger

* Manual execution
  The default way to create a pipeline is manually executed, so simply add a stage\
  Manual plug-in: manual execution pipeline. After the pipeline is established, click Save in the upper right corner and manually click the button of execution pipeline

Because the Manual triggering mode is not selected, the "Execute" button cannot be clicked manually to execute the pipeline
