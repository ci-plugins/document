# Code check configuration

## Execution mode

Plug-in execution can be synchronous or asynchronous. In synchronous mode, code inspection tasks are created while the plug-in is in use. In the asynchronous mode, you need to create a code review task of the "self-created task" type on the code review page, and then select the corresponding task in the pipeline. **Synchronous execution mode:**

**Asynchronous execution mode:**

The **synchronous execution mode** is recommended

## Scan configuration

**Incremental scan:** Scan for code differences between this build and the last build. The first scan was full. **MR/PR scan:** Scan the difference code between the source and target branches of MR/PR. The source branch code needs to be pulled into the workspace. 

**Full scan:** Scan all code. Klocwork, Pinpoint, Gometalinter, and repetition rate only support this scanning mode.

## Path mask

Path mask: Path whitelist and Path blacklist Path **whitelist:** After this parameter is set, code check scans only the files in the whitelist path. Wildcard characters are supported. In absolute path `/data/landun/workspace/CodeCCTest/cpp/`For example: 

1. Scan the relative path`/CodeCCTest/cpp/`, input only`/cpp/`Will not take effect; Scan for a file such as protobuffer`*.pb.cc`, you can enter`.*/.*\.pb\.cc`; 
2.  Scan a folder in the workspace, such as P2PLive, and enter it`.*/P2PLive/.*`; 
3. Scan only certain types of files in a folder, such as P2PLive`*.c`, you can enter`.*/P2PLive/.*\.c`; 
4. If multiple paths or path matching type are entered in a row, separate them using commas (,). 
5. Support pipeline variables

**Path blacklist:** Code check does not scan all files in the path. Wildcard characters are supported. 

1. Mask certain files, such as those generated by protobuffer `*.pb.cc`, you can enter`.*/.*\.pb\.cc`; 
2.  Mask a folder in all branches, such as P2PLive`.*/P2PLive/.*`; 
3. Mask certain files in a folder, for example, P2PLive`*.c`, you can enter`.*/P2PLive/.*\.c`; 
4.  If multiple path matching modes are entered in a line, separate them with commas (,). 
5. Support pipeline variables
