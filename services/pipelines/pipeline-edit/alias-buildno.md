# Enable custom build number for pipeline

## Why do I need a custom build number?

The default pipeline build number consists of a self-increasing number of 1. To increase recognition, we allow you to set an alias for the pipeline build number, which will give priority to your custom build number format on the page display.

## Opening method

Just go to the pipeline base settings page and set the corresponding build number rules, e.gï¼š

```text
${{DATE:"yyMMdd"}}.${{BUILD_NO_OF_DAY}}
```
