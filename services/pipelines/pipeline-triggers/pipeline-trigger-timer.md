# Scheduled triggers

The timed trigger mode allows users to trigger the pipeline at a specified time. This mode is suitable for scenarios where you want to trigger the pipeline at a time when build resources are free (for example, late at night). Users can choose base rules and crontab expressions, both at the same time.
**Note:**The trigger time depends on the server time. You are advised to adjust the time zone of the BKCI server to the time zone of the user
