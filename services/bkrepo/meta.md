# Metadata specification

## What is metadata

Just like a photo has a resolution, a location, and a file size, an artifact also has its own tags, which we call "metadata"

## What metadata does a product need to have

Metadata KEY | Metadata Value | Remarks
-- | --- | ---
pipeline_id | p-xxxxxx | Generate the pipeline ID for this component
build_id | b-xxxxxx | 

## How to write metadata filters

A set of Key/Value writes are currently supported.

`key:value`
