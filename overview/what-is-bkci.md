BK Continuous Integration Platform (codenamed bk-ci) is a free and open source CI service that helps you automate build-test-release workflows to deliver your products consistently, quickly, and with high quality.

Use bk-ci to block out all the tedious aspects of the development process and let you focus on coding. It is commonly used for:

* Engineering compilation
* Static code check
Run test cases to find bugs in time
* Deployment and release

bk-ci provides 5 core services: pipeline, code base, credential management, environment management, and R&D store, with multiple combinations to meet the needs of different enterprise scenarios.

* **Pipeline** : Present the team's existing research and development process in a visual way, compile, test, deployment, complete in one pipeline
* **Code base** : Associates existing code hosting services within the enterprise to bk-ci
* **Credential Management** : Provides different types of credential and certificate management functions for code base, pipeline and other services
* **Environmental Management** : Can be the enterprise internal development compiler hosting to bk-ci
* **R&D Store** : It is composed of pipeline plug-in and pipeline template. The plug-in is used to connect various third-party services within the enterprise. The template helps standardize the internal R & D process of the enterprise

Currently, bk-ci has been open sourced on GitHub: [https://github.com/Tencent/bk-ci](https://github.com/Tencent/bk-ci) , welcome to build together.
