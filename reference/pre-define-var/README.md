# List of predefined variables

Reasonable use of variables can facilitate the maintenance pipeline. bk-ci provides a lot of system variables.

> Note: Variable means variable, which can be overwritten by users and plug-ins. Therefore, in the process of use, you should be careful to overwrite so as not to affect your own business logic. bk-ci has no system constant, and everything is left to the user to decide

Usage: In plug-in configuration, enter ${variable name} to get the value of the corresponding variable. Example: ${BK_CI_PIPELINE_NAME}
