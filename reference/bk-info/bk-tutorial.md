## **Deployment and Maintenance of BK Platform**

The BK Community Edition base package installation media is divided into [package](https://bk.tencent.com/docs/document/6.0/127/7552) (src) and [deployment script](https://bk.tencent.com/docs/document/6.0/127/ 7555) package (install). Through rsync + ssh, each module in the package is distributed to the specified machine on demand, and the deployment script installs software dependencies, automatically generates configuration files, initializes the database, configures accounts and permissions, etc., and finally starts the process.

The Community Edition currently supports the following two installation options (before starting the installation, please refer to the [Environment Preparation](https://bk.tencent.com/docs/document/6.0/127/7543) document and prepare the [Installation Media](https://bk.tencent.com/docs/)) document/6.0/127/7550) to configure the system environment.)

Stand-alone deployment: For first-time users looking for a fastest way to experience and evaluate the core features of BK, please refer to the [Stand-alone Deployment Document](https://bk.tencent.com/docs/document/6.0/127/7551?r=1) for a quick way to experience the features of the BK base platform.

## **BK SaaS Development**

SaaS development is the basic skill of "O&M development". Based on the services of PaaS platform "Developer Center", it helps O&M students to build operational systems/tools at low cost. A SaaS development consists of two parts, one is the front-end, BK provides the draggable [Front-end MagicBox](https://magicbox.bk.tencent.com/), which can generate UI components and code for the front-end; the other part is the back-end, BK provides the ["Development Framework "](https://bk.tencent.com/docs/document/6.0/130/5949?r=1), which integrates public backend modules, such as login, API calls, etc.
